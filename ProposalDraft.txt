11/7 meeting with professor:

1. Use 2014 "Birth Data Files" - for successful births (~5 GB data)
2. Use 2014 "Period Linked Birth-Infant Death Data Files" (~5 GB data)

Metrics:
------------
1. Which features are most pre-dominant in successful births 
2. Which features are most pre-dominant in unsuccessful births

Prediction:
-----------
1. Based on features values can we predict the survival of the infant in %.


Utilize at least 3 of the concepts below, with at least one from data pipelines:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Pipelines (Frameworks): Spark
Analytics: Similarity Search, Link Analysis, Linear Modeling, Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction,  Large-Scale Machine Learning, Distributed TensorFlow (need to figure out which ones will be most applicable besides machine learning)



Tasks:
-------
All presentations should include: 
●	(Anurag)Big Picture Scope: Problem definition (if applicable) or need in society addressed  
●	(Anurag)Motivation: Why big data? Why should people care?
●	(Renu)Sustainable Development Goal: How are you addressing the SDG?
●	(Renu)Data Description: Source(s), number of variables / features. Number of observations.
●	(Keshav)Methods Proposed.  How are you going to solve / analyze. 
●	(Keshav)Specific Experiments / Analyses Proposed: What are the specific experiments or analyses you intend to run? 
●	(Shayan)Mock-up or Preliminary Results: What are the key figures / tables you home to come out of your work-- show a “fake” example rather than just tell. Any prototyping on small data?
●	Team Work. What will each team member be responsible for? (may deviate based on how project develops, but teams at least need a plan). 
●	(Shayan)Summary of course concepts. (1 slide): Identify how it relates to the course.
●	Conclusion (1 slide): Summarize the main contributions of your work. 


Topics to figure out:
---------------------
1. 	Similarity Search (Anurag)
2.  Distributed Tensor Flow (Renu)
3. 	Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction(Keshav)
4.  Large Scale Machine Learning (Shayan)
