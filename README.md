## Infant Mortality Data Prediction and Analysis

### Motivation
Done as part of the class project for [Big Data Analytics (Fall '17)](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~has/CSE545/) course taught by Prof. Andrew Schwartz at Stony Brook University.

### Introduction

We analyzed the infant mortality data from Center for Disease Control and Prevention and designed a framework to predict the risk of infant death and provide reference to similar pregnancy cases in the past to help the doctors in taking informed decision.
