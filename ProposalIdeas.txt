Anurag:
---------------
Metrics:
	1. Method of delivery
	2. Tobacco Usage
	3. Father age
	
Prediction:
	1. Does risk of fetal death increases as method of delivery is changed or different methods are used to reduce the risk which is already high.
	2. Does Tobacco usage by mother increases the risk of fetal death or does it have any other effects during the pregnancy time.
	3. Does the risk of fetal death increases with the increases in age of the father. What can be done to reduce this?

Renu:
---------------
Metrics:
	1. Education
	2. Hispanic origin
	3. Race data

Prediction:
	1. Does educated parents have any effect on the fetal death. May be educated parents earn more, hence they can spend more money to go to good doctors and can eat healthy food.
	2. Does Hispanic origin has any relation to fetal death. Hispanic origin people are less likely to be obese and are more fit compared to normal americans, this might be the reason that Hispanic origin people have different fetal death rate.
	3. Similar to hispanic people, race data can be used to show correlation between healthy lifestyle of different rates and their corresponding fetal death rate.
	
	



Shayan:
---------------

Metrics:
---------
	1. Apgar score by race across datasets 
	2. abnormal conditions of newborn by race/maernal health
	3. What is the leading cause of death in US ? 
	4. Correlation amongst the features


Prediction:
-----------
	a. Maternal Morbidity  			[Insights: assess risk of mother's life]
	b. Weight at Delivery  			[Insights: take preventive measures, if possible] 
	c. Possible cause of death  	[Insights: take preventive measures, if possible]
	d. can we predict successful birth or not based on existing conditions of health for the mother and smoking etc habits, gestation parameters?
	e. predict apgar score based on features like mother's health and habits and race
